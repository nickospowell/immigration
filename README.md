This was a project that looked at US visas from around the world. It looked at different countries and their likelihoods of getting a visa to the US. This data was fitted into a gaussian model and that uses the probability of getting a visa as a function of the origin of the person asking for it. The data is then made into a plot that shows the likelihood of getting a visa.
